# ProjectMark code challenge

## Description
This is part of ProjectMark's code challenge. The app consists of an onboard page, allowing users to choose one of the offered sales pipeline types. The pipelines are incremental, starting from the basic, which has the least options and goes to the expert and custom with all the supported pipelines. 

Currently, expert and custom are the same. This is an intentional choice. Since no further explanation was provided, the user should be able to choose the pipelines in the additional onboarding steps, not targeted by this challenge.
